            I am a 17-year old French American girl, born and raised in
            California. I live in Silver Lake, a tightly-knit neighborhood of
            Los Angeles, with my parents, 15-year old sister, 10-year old
            brother and two adorable cats. My siblings and I live in a bilingual
            household, with my French mother speaking exclusively french to us,
            and my American father speaking exclusively english to us. Growing
            up in a bicultural home has deeply shaped my personal identity. For
            example, it has inspired me to be bold and live abroad in France for
            my sophomore school year.

                    Currently, I am tutoring two young students in math and ELA
                    online once a week each. Tutoring with SOW involves

                    The LAPL Teen Leadership Council, also known as Teens
                    Leading Change (TLC), exists to give teenagers an
                    opportunity to do a yearly creative community service
                    project in the Silver Lake area. Once a week for 1-2 hours,
                    our group would meet up to delegate tasks, review our
                    individual progress from the week before, and plan out the
                    remainder of our project. Our central theme was
                    environmental activism. Initially, our intention was to host
                    workshops oriented towards local businesses addressing the
                    reasons and proper etiquette for recycling. We gathered
                    funding for recycling bins to give away, wrote informational
                    pamphlets, and designed an appropriate logo. Our hope was
                    that if local businesses dealt with trash properly, we could
                    improve the overall state of pollution in our neighborhood.
                    Unfortunately, when COVID-19 hit and social distancing was
                    imposed, hosting workshops was no longer a feasible option.
                    We had to completely reconsider what type of project we
                    could do. Ultimately, my group wrote and published a free
                    children's book with the underlying purpose of informing
                    younger children about recycling. Once we finished, we gave
                    a live presentation to other library branches about our
                    work. I was in charge of researching and writing the
                    workshopâ€™s informational pamphlet, designing the promotional
                    flyer, co-outlining the plot of the children's book and
                    creating its title page.

                    In the summer before ninth grade, I attended the UCLA Mock
                    Trial Summer Institute. This program focused on teaching the
                    basics of the US legal system in the form of lectures and a
                    final exam. Students were also expected to participate in a
                    mock trial simulation. Participating in the Mock Trial
                    Institute broadened my understanding and interest in our
                    government system. Therefore, after both attending this
                    summer program, my friend and I decided to co-found our own
                    Mock Trial club at John Marshall High School. We designed
                    flyers and hosted an informational session to promote our
                    club. Once we had committed members, we held weekly meetings
                    transferring our newfound knowledge and held our own
                    in-class simulation.

                    Initially, being part of peer mediation at my school meant

                    activities- I designed the peer mediation T-shirt logo, for
                    example. We would spend one or two of our lunches a week
                    sitting cross-legged on the floor of the counselorâ€™s office,
                    listening to her discuss effective methods for dealing with
                    conflict. We had guest speakers come lecture us and we even
                    attended a full-day seminar. Once I was deemed â€˜readyâ€™, I
                    began to arbitrate actual arguments between students. My
                    responsibility was guiding the conversations in a positive
                    direction and making sure that both sides were treated
                    equally and respectfully. Providing my fellow students with
                    an opportunity to share their thought processes and explain
                    themselves as I, as a peer, listened empathetically has

                    where I help the coaches guide runs and frequently work

                    Since middle school, I have played club volleyball at San
                    Gabriel Elite. Once I entered high school I joined my
                    schools' teams as well. My volleyball schedule has involved
                    3-5 school volleyball practices per week, 2 club practices
                    per week, and 2 club clinics every weekend in addition to
                    monthly club tournaments and weekly school matches during
                    each season. In my opinion, the most important element of
                    volleyball is teamwork. You can have the most skilled
                    players in the world, but if they are unable to coordinate
                    with each other effectively, their talent cannot be
                    exploited. Playing volleyball for years has taught me
                    important communication skills and the ability to work as a
                    team.
