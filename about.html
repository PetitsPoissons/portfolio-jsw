          <p class="about-content--para about-p">
            I am a 17-year old French American girl, born and raised in
            California. I live in Silver Lake, a tightly-knit neighborhood of
            Los Angeles, with my parents, 15-year old sister, 10-year old
            brother and two adorable cats. My siblings and I live in a bilingual
            household, with my French mother speaking exclusively french to us,
            and my American father speaking exclusively english to us. Growing
            up in a bicultural household has deeply shaped my personal identity
            and inspired me during sophomore year to move to France and spend
            10th grade in La Rochelle, France with my great-grandmother. This
            experience was very challenging but ultimately the most amazing and
            rewarding experience of my life. Adapting to this new environment
            gave me the opportunity to venture out of my comfort zone and learn
            a lot about myself, my interests and my aspirations. A striking
            aspect of my time in France was the period it occurred in. I arrived
            in France two months before both the yellow vest movement and the
            environmental protests began. Learning about the purposes and values
            of each movement- whether I supported them or not- offered me
            insight into the way that the French political system works as well
            as the values upheld by its citizens. Experiencing the impact of
            these movements firsthand and the other experiences I had during my
            year abroad has made me realize that I am deeply interested in
            studying political science and global relations at university.
            <p class="about-content--para about-p">I am
            very passionate about environmental activism. I believe it is the
            responsibility of my generation to take charge of global warming and
            fight to save our planet. To educate myself and learn more about
            environmental activism, I have been participating in environmental
            clubs and projects at my various high schools since sophomore year.
            I hope to participate in similar and more impactful ventures in
            college.</p><p class="about-content--para about-p">Some of my less intense but favorite hobbies include
            reading, drawing, coding and learning new languages such as Spanish and Mandarin. I also hope to
            continue these throughout my years in college.</p>
